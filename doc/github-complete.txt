INTRODUCTION                                  *github-complete.vim-introduction*


*github-complete* is a completion plugin to complete things related to GitHub.
It generates, caches and contextually shows candidates of completion via
GitHub API.
|github-complete| provides below completions.

- Emoji completion
- Issue completion
- User name completion
- Repository name completion
- Link URL completion


==============================================================================
INSTALL                                            *github-complete.vim-install*

If you don't use any plugin manager, copy all files in autoload/, plugin/ and
ftplugin/ to your .vim directory.

If you use a plugin manager, please follow the instruction of it to install
|github-complete|.

In order to use asynchronous communication with GitHub API, please install
vimproc.vim in advance.

https://github.com/Shougo/vimproc.vim

Note: They are optional.  Installing them is not mandatory to use
|github-complete| but I recommend it.

Below is an example for |neobundle.vim|.
>
    NeoBundle 'Shougo/vimproc.vim'
    NeoBundle 'rhysd/github-complete.vim'
<
|github-complete| uses "curl" or "wget" command to send requests to GitHub
API.  Please make sure to install at least one of them in your system. (They
are usually pre-installed in *nix system.)


==============================================================================
USAGE                                                *github-complete.vim-usage*

|github-complete| set 'omnifunc' when no other omnifunc is set on filetypes
"gitcommit" and "markdown".  In the case, you need not to setup any
configuration.  Otherwise, set "github_complete#complete" to 'omnifunc' in
your favorite filetypes in your |vimrc|.
Please make sure the proper 'omnifunc' is set with ":set omnifunc" in intended
filetypes.
For example, following code sets 'omnifunc' in "gitcommit" filetype
>
    augroup config-github-complete
        autocmd!
        autocmd FileType gitcommit setl omnifunc=github_complete#complete
    augroup END
<
Now you can use contextual completions with <C-X><C-O>.  I'll show an example
use cases for each completion.
                                                               |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O|

Note: "_" means the place of the cursor

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EMOJI COMPLETION                    *github-complete.vim-usage-eomji-completion*

When the cursor is after ":", |github-complete| invokes emoji completion.
If your font can deal with unicode emojis, the items of completion show the
corresponding emojis.
>
    I am a :do_
<
<C-X><C-O> here will show the list of emoji which starts with ":do".  Possible
result of completion is below.
>
    I am a :dog:_
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ISSUE COMPLETION                    *github-complete.vim-usage-issue-completion*

When the cursor is after "#", |github-complete| invokes issue number completion.
You can select an issue with looking the issue titles in items of completion.
>
    I fixed #_
<
<C-X><C-O> here will show the list of issues for current repository.  Possible
result of completion is below.
>
    I fixed #13_
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USER NAME COMPLETION            *github-complete.vim-usage-user-name-completion*

When the cursor is after "@" or "github.com/", |github-complete| invokes
GitHub user name completion.
>
       Hi, @rh_
<
<C-X><C-O> here will show the list of user name which starts with "rh".
Possible result of completion is below.
>
    Hi, @rhysd_
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REPOSITORY COMPLETION          *github-complete.vim-usage-repository-completion*

When the cursor is after the format {user name}/{some query}, |github_complete|
invokes GitHub repository completion.  It shows repositories which {user name}
owns.
>
    Please see github.com/rhysd/cle_
<
<C-X><C-O> here will show the list of repository which rhysd owns and which
starts with "cle".  Possible result of completion is below.
>
    Please see github.com/rhysd/clever-f.vim
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LINK URL COMPLETION                  *github-complete.vim-usage-link-completion*

When writing link to GitHub repository in markdown, you can complete its URL
by the title of link.

On writing "[something](",
>
    Please try [clever-f.vim](
<
<C-X><C-O> searches GitHub repositories by its
title "something" and shows the result.  You can choose one to complete URL
of the link.

VARIABLES                                        *github-complete.vim-variables*

|github-complete| provides many variables to customize the behavior of
completions.

g:github_complete_overwrite_omnifunc_filetypes
                                *g:github_complete_overwrite_omnifunc_filetypes*

    |filetype|s can be set to the variable as a |List| of |string|.  When you
    open the buffer whose filetype is included in the variable, 'omnifunc'
    would be overwritten by "github_complete#complete" automatically even if
    other omni function is already set.
    Default value is [].

    e.g.
>
    let g:github_complete_overwrite_omnifunc_filetypes = ["gitcommit"]
<
g:github_complete_enable_neocomplete      *g:github_complete_enable_neocomplete*

    Setting 1 to the variable enables all neocomplete sources by default.
    See |github-complete.vim-neocomplete-sources| for more detail.
    Default value is 0.

g:github_complete_enable_emoji_completion
                                     *g:github_complete_enable_emoji_completion*

    Setting 1 to the variable enables emoji completion.
    Default value is 1.

g:github_complete_enable_issue_completion
                                     *g:github_complete_enable_issue_completion*

    Setting 1 to the variable enables issue number completion.
    Default value is 1.

g:github_complete_enable_user_completion
                                      *g:github_complete_enable_user_completion*

    Setting 1 to the variable enables GitHub user completion.
    Default value is 1.

g:github_complete_enable_repo_completion
                                      *g:github_complete_enable_repo_completion*

    Setting 1 to the variable enables GitHub repository name completion.
    Default value is 1.

g:github_complete_include_issue_title    *g:github_complete_include_issue_title*

    When 1 is set to the variable, item of issue number completion includes
    the title of issue.  If you want to include the title of issue in your
    writing text, it may be helpful.
    Default value is 0.

g:github_complete_max_issue_candidates
                                        *g:github_complete_max_issue_candidates*

    When the repository is very big, issue number completion takes much time
    because of many issues.  This variable limits the number of candidates of
    issue number completion.  When non-positive number is set, it means no
    limit.
    Default value is 100.

g:github_complete_issue_request_params
                                        *g:github_complete_issue_request_params*

    This is a dictionary of parameters used to request the github issue api. It
    allows to have more control on what issue to show. For example, show only
    the opened, assigned to you, labeled as bug issue:
    {'state' : 'open', 'assignee' : 'your-username', 'label' : 'bug' }
    Default value is {'state' : 'all'}.

g:github_complete_git_cmd                            *g:github_complete_git_cmd*

    The command name of git.  It is used to look up the information of current
    repository.
    Default value is "git".

g:github_complete_fetch_issue_api_filetypes
                                   *g:github_complete_fetch_issue_api_filetypes*

    The list of filetypes to fetch GitHub issue API call.  When the filetype
    is set, |github-complete| instantly sends issue API call in the background.
    After you consider your nice commit message, the API call might already be
    done and you can use issue number completion instantly.
    However, it takes a bit at setting the filetype because it sends API call
    every time the filetype is set.
    Default value is [ "gitcommit" ].

g:github_complete_emoji_japanese_workaround
                                   *g:github_complete_emoji_japanese_workaround*

    Some environments can't show emoji in item of emoji completion.  When this
    variable is set to 1, |github-complete| provides the workaround for the
    description of items of emoji completion.  It shows a description of
    the corrensponding item of completion in Japanese.
    For example, when you input ":do", items are shown such as ":dog2: -> 犬".
    Default value is 0.

g:github_complete_fallback_omnifunc        *g:github_complete_fallback_omnifunc*

    If a name of some function is set to the variable, |github-complete| uses
    the function when no completion is available.  If an empty string is set,
    |github-complete| invokes emoji completion and issue completion at the
    same time.
    If you already use omni function foo_bar#complete() and also want to use
    |github-complete| at the same time, set "foo_bar#complete" to the variable
    might help you.
    Default value is "".

    e.g.
>
    let g:github_complete_fallback_omnifunc = "some#other#complete"
<
g:github_complete_enable_api_cache          *g:github_complete_enable_api_cache*

    If this variable is set to 1, |github-complete| caches the result of
    GitHub API call.  Otherwise, it doesn't.
    Default value is 1.

g:github_complete_enable_omni_completion
                                      *g:github_complete_enable_omni_completion*

    If this variable is set to 1, github-complete.vim automatically defines
    'omnifunc' on "gitcommit", "markdown" and "magit" filetypes.
    Default value is 1.

g:github_complete_github_api_token          *g:github_complete_github_api_token*

    You can specify a token for GitHub API as string.  If you obtain a token
    with properly scopes, github-complete.vim will have the ability to access
    to private repositories.  And API rate limit is increased to 5000 from 60
    per hour.
    This value is set to environmental variable $GITHUB_API_TOKEN.  If it is
    empty, simply empty string is set.  When empty string is set,
    github-complete.vim won't use a token to call GitHub API.

    To obtain GitHub API token, please access GitHub page as below:

        1. Access to https://github.com
        2. Click your icon and select 'Settings' in pull-down menu.
        3. Select 'Personal access tokens' tab.
        4. Click 'Generate new token' button.
        5. Specify properly scopes. (If you don't want to access private
           repository, select nothing.)
        6. Click 'Genrate token' button and copy the displayed token.

    Note: Please do not expose your token.  It's secret.

g:github_complete_ghe_host                          *g:github_complete_ghe_host*

    If you're a user of Github Enterprise, set this variable to your host.
    Default value is "".

    e.g.
>
    let g:github_complete_ghe_host = 'github.mycompany.io'
<
==============================================================================
MAPPINGS                                          *github-complete.vim-mappings*

<Plug>(github-complete-manual-completion)
                                     *<Plug>(github-complete-manual-completion)*

    This mapping starts completion manually.  You can define custom mapping to
    use completions of github-complete.vim rather than omni completion.  This
    mapping is defined only in insert mode. >

    " Disable overwriting 'omnifunc'
    let g:github_complete_enable_omni_completion = 0
    " <C-x><C-x> invokes completions of github-complete.vim
    autocmd FileType markdown,gitcommit
        \ imap <C-x><C-x> <Plug>(github-complete-manual-completion)
<

==============================================================================
NEOCOMPLETE SOURCES                    *github-complete.vim-neocomplete-sources*

|github-complete| includes the sources of |neocomplete|.

https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplete.vim

You can use below sources via neocomplete's automatic completion.

- "github_emoji" ... Emoji completion after ":"
- "github_issue" ... Issue number completion after "#"
- "github_user"  ... User completion after "@" or "github.com/"
- "github_repo"  ... Repository completion after "{user name}/"

You can enable all sources by setting |g:github_complete_enable_neocomplete|
to 1.  When it is set to 1, sources would be enabled in "gitcommit" and
"markdown" filetypes.  If you want to control enabling individual sources,
please see documentation of neocomplete and use neocomplete's way.

Note: Above neocomplete sources are not tested yet because I don't know how to
do that.  They may be buggy.

Note: |neocomplete| invoke completion automatically.  Sometimes too many API
calls are sent to GitHub API and some requests may be denied. (Their response
will be 403.)

==============================================================================
RECOMMENDED PLUGIN                      *github-complete.vim-recommended-plugin*

* github-issues.vim

https://github.com/jaxbot/github-issues.vim

This plugin treats GitHub issues in Vim.  Note that github-issues.vim provides
its own omni completion.  You should set g:github_issues_no_omni and set
'omnifunc' to "github_complete#complete" in issue buffers to use
|github-complete|.
